## Contributing to SAS Powerschool Enhancement Suite

Thank you for considering contributing to SAS Powerschool Enhancement Suite.

If you're just starting out, have a look at the issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/gary-kim/saspes/labels/good%20first%20issue). You can also take a look at the issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/gary-kim/saspes/labels/help%20wanted).

### Building
SAS PES uses Webpack so you will have to run a few commands to get a development version of the extension.

First of all, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for your platform. Follow the installation instructions on the [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/en/) or take a look in your OS's package manager.

After running the following commands, you will have a directory named `dist`. You can then add this directory in as an extension in your browser of choice.

#### For Firefox
```
npm install

# Development Mode
npm run webpack:dev:firefox

# Production Mode
npm run webpack:build:firefox
```

#### For Chromium/Chromium based browsers
```
npm install

# Development Mode
npm run webpack:dev:chromium

# Production Mode
npm run webpack:build:chromium
```

### Make a new release

1. Ensure that all CI tests pass on the latest commit.
2. Update the version number with `npm version [major|minor|patch] --no-git` and update the version name manually in [package.json](package.json).
3. Run `npm ci` to install all dependencies for building from [package-lock.json](package-lock.json).
4. Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with the update changelog for the new version.
5. Make a new git commit and tag with `git commit -S`,  `git tag VERSION -a`, add the new version name as the annotation, then run `git push origin VERSION`.
6. Run `npm run clean`, `npm run webpack:build:firefox`, then `npm run package`. Upload the resulting package to [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons) to have the extension signed. Upload the result into GitHub releases then update the update server to point to the new release.
7. Run `npm run clean`, `npm run webpack:build:chromium`, then `npm run package`. Upload the resulting package to [CWS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard) to have the new version signed and released.
